  <div class="panel-body"><h4>We found that there are many book lovers who want to read books of past, books of every genre. People cannot purchase each and every book thatâ€™s there. Though many books are available online, many old author books are no more for sale. Some want to keep their books with themselves while some just want to give away.</h4>
<h4>Over last two years we had been gathering old books from people of different places. Its been a long journey that we had to notify people through various ways and make them know that its possible to exchange books instead of regretting for not purchasing earlier.</h4>
<h4>We formed groups from different places and collected books from lots of book lovers who were happy to donate books just like that. We gathered various genre books and now spreading to various other places. We thank all the people who donated books as soon as we asked.</h4>
